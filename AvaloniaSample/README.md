### Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This demo sample integrates [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net) framework within [Urho.Net](https://github.com/Urho-Net/Urho.Net).\
This demo runs only on desktop platforms , it won't run on mobile devices (I don't have any plans to support it on mobile devices).  
Avalonia is running inside a [Urho.Net](https://github.com/Urho-Net/Urho.Net) context resulting in a super fast render cycle. \
[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net)  communicates with [Urho.Net](https://github.com/Urho-Net/Urho.Net) through a glue layer ,the 'glue' source code can be found in the Urho.Avalonia folder.

The motivation behind it is to provide a robust and production ready first class UI framework for Urho.Net .\
It will allow to implement various Desktop development tools that require state of the art GUI (i.e. Game Editor)

This demo is considered to be feature complete and was verified to be running on Windws,Linux and macOS.\
It is based upon a reference implementation found in another framework [Urho3DNet](https://github.com/gleblebedev/Urho3DNet.Extras )

[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net) is a cross-platform XAML-based UI framework providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of Operating Systems such as Windows , macOS and Linux.\
It is being used by leading companies in the SW development industry
such as [JetBrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/04/12/improvements-for-resharper-rider-avalonia/)

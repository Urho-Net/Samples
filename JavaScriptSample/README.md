### Description
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a showcase of a JavaScript code running inside .NET utilizing  [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint)  a Javascript interpreter.  \
Runs on all supported platforms , macOS,Windows,Linux,iOS,Android .

It took me literally less than an hour to figure out how to use JInt and write this demo.
I am not a Javascript guy , it's not my cup of tea , but it's cool to see such a solution that allows fluent bi-directional interaction between the .NET side and the Javascript side  and at the same time allows easy integration into a .NET application with zero effort.

The project conatains 2 precompiled assemblies , they can be found in the References folder , **Jint.dll** and **Esprima.dll**\
They are referenced in 2 places , **JavaScriptSample.csproj** and **project_vars.sh** .\
This is a must to make it work both on desktop and mobile.


I don't see any practical uasge for this Javascript demo , I consider it to be just  a nice little P.O.C. demo .
